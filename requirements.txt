# Requirements for running demo notebook and UQ coverage experiment
# 
# Installation:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Or for CUDA support (recommended for GPU):
#   pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Usage:
#   - Demo notebook: jupyter notebook demo.ipynb
#   - Coverage experiment: python scripts/uq_simulation_analysis.py --experiment coverage --methods DPS DAPS --N 200 --K 100
